# Read pff file in MATLAB
The code is used for reading pff file in MATLAB, which is based on some python scripts.
Therefore, what you need to are:
* install pyjson, numpy on your system
```
    pip install pyjson
    pip install numpy
```
* put read_pff.m, read_pff_wrapper.py and pff.py in the same directory.  
***PS***: read_pff_example.m is an example about how to use the code to read pff file.  
* **DO NOT** change the file name created by hashpipe code!!!
